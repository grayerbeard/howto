# Conversation about Documenting Python Based Control System

### **Question:**
Can you please suggest some sort of tool that would help me describe the python application I am putting together. It will control my heating and hot water system. It will us Rhasspy, MQTT and Tuya devices and use several python modules.  I need to have some way to document and show how modules interact under various circumstances.

### **Answer**
It sounds like you need a tool to create visual diagrams to help you document your Python application and illustrate the interactions between different components. There are several tools you can use to achieve this, both open-source and commercial:

* **Draw.io** (also known as diagrams.net): This is a free, open-source diagramming tool that allows you to create flowcharts, UML diagrams, and system architecture diagrams. It's available as a web application, desktop application, or integrated into tools like Visual Studio Code. Website: [www.diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/)

*  **Lucidchart:** A popular, cloud-based diagramming tool with a wide range of diagramming options, including flowcharts, UML diagrams, and system architecture diagrams. It offers a free version with limited features and paid plans with advanced features. Website: [www.lucidchart.com](https://www.lucidchart.com/)

* **Visual Paradigm:** A comprehensive tool for visual modeling and diagramming. It supports UML, BPMN, SysML, ERD, and other diagram types. It offers a community edition with basic features and paid versions with more advanced features. Website: [www.visual-paradigm.com](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/)

* **PlantUML:** An open-source tool that allows you to create UML diagrams using a simple text-based language. You can easily integrate it with code editors, version control systems, and documentation generators. It's suitable for documenting the architecture and interactions of your Python application. Website: [plantuml.com](https://plantuml.com/)

* **Mermaid:** A JavaScript-based, open-source diagramming library that enables you to generate diagrams using a simple text-based syntax. It can be easily integrated with Markdown files, making it suitable for including diagrams within your project documentation. Website: [mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)

Choose the tool that best suits your needs and preferences. Some tools are more user-friendly with drag-and-drop interfaces, while others may require you to learn their specific syntax. Consider factors like ease of use, integrations, collaboration features, and compatibility with your existing documentation when making your decision.

### **Question:**
I have looked at those five  applications for diagrams and I feel they could take a while to learn to use well and also they are aimed at systems that are more complex than my, relatively, simple house heating and hot water system controller that will use Python (and Flask) and  MQTT on a Raspberry Pi 4.  Can you please suggest a way to describe the interfaces between my Python Modukles and the moodules functions that does would be easier but adequate.

### **Answer**
If you're looking for a simpler way to describe the interfaces between your Python modules and their functions, you might consider using comments and docstrings within your code, along with creating a basic README file for your project. This approach is more lightweight and can be easier to maintain as your project evolves.

* **Comments:** Use comments within your code to provide brief explanations of what specific sections or lines of code do. In Python, you can create single-line comments using the # symbol. For example:

```python
     # This function turns the heating on
    def turn_heating_on():
    # Function code here
```
* **Docstrings:** Write docstrings for your modules, classes, and functions to explain their purpose and how they should be used. In Python, docstrings are written using triple quotes ("""). They appear right after the definition of a module, class, or function. For example:

```python
    def set_temperature(temp):
    """
    Set the target temperature for the heating system.

    Args:
    temp (float): The target temperature in degrees Celsius.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the temperature was set successfully, False otherwise.
    """
    # Your code here
```


* **README file:** Create a README.md file for your project, which serves as an overview and entry point for anyone looking at your project. This file should contain:

    A brief introduction to your project, explaining its purpose.
    An overview of the main components (modules, classes, and functions) and how they interact with each other.
    Instructions on how to set up, configure, and run your project.

    You can use simple Markdown syntax to format your README file, making it easy to read on platforms like GitHub.

    By combining well-documented code with a clear README file, you can effectively describe the interfaces between your Python modules and their functions without the need for specialized diagramming tools. This approach will be more straightforward and faster to maintain, especially for a relatively simple project like your home heating and hot water system controller.

### **Question:**
Can you suggest a check list I could use to ensure each module is sufficiently described and each interaction between modules is covered.

### **Answer**
Certainly! Here's a checklist to help you ensure that each module is sufficiently described and that the interactions between modules are well-documented:

## **Module Checklist:**

* **Module-level docstring:**
        Briefly describe the module's purpose and functionality.
        List any external dependencies or required configurations.
        Mention any important classes, functions, or variables provided by the module.

* **Classes:**
        Include a docstring for each class, describing its purpose and functionality.
        Document class attributes and their intended use.

* **Functions and methods:**
    
    Write a docstring for each function and method, including the following information:

        - A brief description of its purpose.
        - Its input arguments (including their types and any default values).
        - Its return value (including its type).
        - Any exceptions that it may raise.
        
    Ensure that function and method names are descriptive and follow the naming conventions of your project.


* **Variables and constants:** 

    Document any important global variables or constants, explaining their purpose and intended use.
        Make sure variable and constant names are descriptive and follow the naming conventions of your project.

* **Code comments:** 
        Use inline comments to explain complex or non-obvious sections of code.
        Keep comments concise and clear.

## * **Interaction Checklist:**

* **Module interactions:**

Describe how modules interact with one another, including any shared data structures, communication channels, or protocols.
Document any assumptions made about the behavior of other modules, including any required preconditions or postconditions.

* **Function and method calls between modules:**

Explain how functions and methods from one module are used by another module, including any necessary setup or cleanup steps.
Document any required input arguments, return values, or exceptions.

* **Data flow:**

Describe how data flows between modules, including any data transformations or conversions that occur.
Document the types of data being passed between modules, as well as any constraints or validation requirements.

* **Error handling and exceptions:**

Explain how errors and exceptions are propagated between modules and how they are handled.
        Document any specific error conditions or exceptions that must be handled by the calling module.

* **README file:**

Provide a high-level overview of module interactions and data flow within the project.
Include any necessary setup or configuration instructions.
include examples or use cases to illustrate how the various modules work together.

By following this checklist, you can ensure that your modules are well-documented, and their interactions are clear and easy to understand.

## Readme File Formating

Headings are made with the "#" symbol with "#" for top level and then "##" and "###" etc for next levels. e.g.

```Markdown
# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3
```
Resulting in:

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

&nbsp; 

**Bold and __Underline__**  Bold is achieved using double asterixes or double underline but the underline requires the non standarrd \<u> which should work in most cased. e.g.

```Markdown
__This is Bold__ 

and 

**This is bold**

and

<u>This is underlined</u>
```

Resulting in:
__This is Bold__ 

and 

**This is bold**

and

<u>This is underlined</u>

&nbsp;

Hyper links us Square and Round Brackets so

```Markdown
[mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)
```

Results in:
