Is it possible to run Edge on Debian 12
Chat GPT
Yes, it's possible to run Microsoft Edge on Debian 12, although it's not included in the default Debian repositories since Edge is developed by Microsoft, a separate entity from the Debian project. However, Microsoft provides support for Edge on Linux, and you can install it on Debian systems using Microsoft's packages.

Here's a general outline of the steps you would take to install Microsoft Edge on Debian 12:

1. **Download Microsoft's GPG Key**: You need to download and install the Microsoft GPG key, which is used to sign their packages for security.

2. **Add Microsoft's Repository**: You'll add Microsoft's Edge repository to your system's list of repositories.

3. **Update Package Lists**: After adding the new repository, you'll update your package lists to include the newly available packages.

4. **Install Microsoft Edge**: Finally, you can install Edge using the `apt` package manager.

Since the specifics can change and it's important to get the latest instructions, it's recommended to check Microsoft's official documentation or a recent guide for the exact commands and steps.

How to do step 1 please
To download and install the Microsoft GPG key for installing Edge on Debian 12, you'll need to run a few commands in the terminal. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Open Terminal**: First, open a terminal window.

2. **Download the Microsoft GPG Key**: Run the following command to download the Microsoft GPG key:

    ```bash
    wget -qO - https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > microsoft.gpg
    ```

    This command uses `wget` to download the key and then pipes it to `gpg` to convert it into a format that can be used by `apt`.

3. **Install the Key**: After downloading, install the key with this command:

    ```bash
    sudo install -o root -g root -m 644 microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/
    ```

    This command uses `sudo` to run the installation as a superuser, ensuring that it has the necessary permissions to install the key globally.

4. **Remove the Downloaded File**: Once installed, you can safely remove the downloaded file:

    ```bash
    rm microsoft.gpg
    ```

These steps will add the Microsoft GPG key to your system, allowing you to securely install packages from Microsoft's repository. After completing these steps, you can proceed to add Microsoft's Edge repository to your system, update your package lists, and install Edge.

If you encounter any issues or errors during these steps, feel free to ask for further assistance!

To add Microsoft's Edge repository to your Debian 12 system, you'll need to follow these steps after installing the Microsoft GPG key:

1. **Open Terminal**: If it's not already open, start a terminal window.

2. **Add the Microsoft Edge Repository**: You need to add the repository to your system's software sources. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/edge stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft-edge-dev.list
   ```

   This command creates a new file in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` containing the repository information. The `echo` command outputs the repository line, and `sudo tee` writes it to the file, ensuring that it's done with administrative privileges.

3. **Update Package Lists**: After adding the repository, update your package lists to include the new packages available from the Edge repository. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

   This command will refresh your system's package database, incorporating the newly added Microsoft Edge repository.

After completing these steps, your Debian system will be set up to install Microsoft Edge from Microsoft's official repository. The next step is to install Edge using the `apt` package manager. If you need any assistance with that or encounter any issues, feel free to ask!

To make the vertical scroll bar wider and more visible in Debian 12, you can customize the GTK settings. Here are the steps to do so:

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Use a text editor of your choice to create or edit the GTK settings file. You can use the following command to open the file in the nano text editor (you can replace "nano" with your preferred text editor):

   ```bash
   nano ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini
   ```

3. If the file doesn't exist, create it. Otherwise, edit the existing file.

4. Add the following lines to the file to adjust the scroll bar width and visibility:

   ```ini
   [Settings]
   gtk-primary-button-warps-slider = false
   gtk-scroll-bar-width = 15
   ```

   You can adjust the value of `gtk-scroll-bar-width` to your preference. A larger value will make the scroll bar wider and more visible.

5. Save the file and exit the text editor.

6. You may need to restart your graphical environment or log out and back in for the changes to take effect.

This should make the vertical scroll bar wider and easier to see in your Debian 12 environment. Adjust the scroll-bar-width value as needed to suit your preferences.
