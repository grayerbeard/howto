Is it possible to run Edge on Debian 12
Yes, it's possible to run Microsoft Edge on Debian 12, although it's not included in the default Debian repositories since Edge is developed by Microsoft, a separate entity from the Debian project. However, Microsoft provides support for Edge on Linux, and you can install it on Debian systems using Microsoft's packages.

Here's a general outline of the steps you would take to install Microsoft Edge on Debian 12:

1. **Download Microsoft's GPG Key**: You need to download and install the Microsoft GPG key, which is used to sign their packages for security.

2. **Add Microsoft's Repository**: You'll add Microsoft's Edge repository to your system's list of repositories.

3. **Update Package Lists**: After adding the new repository, you'll update your package lists to include the newly available packages.

4. **Install Microsoft Edge**: Finally, you can install Edge using the `apt` package manager.

Since the specifics can change and it's important to get the latest instructions, it's recommended to check Microsoft's official documentation or a recent guide for the exact commands and steps.
